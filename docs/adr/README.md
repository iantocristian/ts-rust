# Architecture Decision Records

One decision per file, numbered. `Status` is `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Amended` or `Superseded`; the status tool reads the `Status:` line. A change that alters a decision amends the record or supersedes it with a new one. See `docs/TRACKING.md`.

| [0019](0019-test-host-protocol-and-transport-contract-tests.md) | Test-host protocol and transport contract tests | Proposed |
| [0020](0020-phase-0-gate-decision.md) | Phase 0 gate decision | Proposed |

The three contracts (0006, 0007, 0013) were accepted by the owner on 2026-09-05 after review of their design notes: [ownership](../design/ownership.md), [symbols](../design/symbols.md) and [text](../design/text.md). Each note cites the pinned upstream code it reproduces and lists what E3 or E4 asserts. ADRs 0019 and 0020 are Proposed placeholders that sprints S11 and S12 name; they are written and accepted at those sprints.

## Proposed, not yet written

Pending technical decisions from the plan's section 13 become records when the owner decides them:

- Storage layout for nodes and types (item 6): an experiment, chosen on E5, E6 and checker-slice measurements.
- Interning (item 8): deferred; decided on measured string duplication.
- Trampolines at the four left-operand recursion sites (item 11): decided by the stress tests.
- Replacement for the `checkchildren` analyzer (item 14): a `rustc_driver`-based lint or dylint, chosen in the spike.
- The spike subset rule and frozen manifest (item 16).
- Whether the fourslash test-host transport is a patch on the pinned harness or a fork (open question 5).
