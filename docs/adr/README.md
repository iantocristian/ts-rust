# Architecture Decision Records

One decision per file, numbered. `Status` is `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Amended` or `Superseded`; the status tool reads the `Status:` line. A change that alters a decision amends the record or supersedes it with a new one. See `docs/TRACKING.md`.

The three contracts (0006, 0007, 0013) are Proposed until the owner has reviewed the design notes that the plan's first step calls for; the direction of each is settled in the plan.

## Proposed, not yet written

Pending technical decisions from the plan's section 13 become records when the owner decides them:

- Storage layout for nodes and types (item 6): an experiment, chosen on E5, E6 and checker-slice measurements.
- Interning (item 8): deferred; decided on measured string duplication.
- Trampolines at the four left-operand recursion sites (item 11): decided by the stress tests.
- Replacement for the `checkchildren` analyzer (item 14): a `rustc_driver`-based lint or dylint, chosen in the spike.
- The spike subset rule and frozen manifest (item 16).
- Whether the fourslash test-host transport is a patch on the pinned harness or a fork (open question 5).
