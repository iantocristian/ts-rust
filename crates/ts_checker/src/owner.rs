//! One checker owner, one operation at a time (plan §4.1; ADR 0007, ADR 0012).
//!
//! `CheckerOwner` holds the exact checker identity and every piece of mutable
//! checker state behind it. An [`Operation`] is the only way to reach that
//! state: it holds the identity's exclusive permit and the state lock together,
//! and drops both together. Inside an operation the checker is a plain
//! single-threaded `&mut` state machine; no lock is taken per node, type,
//! symbol or relation edge.
//!
//! Reentry on the same thread is a bug in the caller, not contention, and is
//! reported before waiting: the thread-local set of active identity leases
//! answers it without touching the lock. Contention from another thread waits
//! normally. A panic inside an operation retires the shared generation before
//! the permit is released (`CheckerLease`'s drop does this); the poisoned state
//! lock is a backstop, never the recovery mechanism.
//!
//! Two lock acquisitions per operation is a known cost of reusing the `ts_arena`
//! permit unchanged. Operations are per query, not per node; P1 measures it and
//! folds the state into the permit if it shows.
