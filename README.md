# ts-rust

The Rust rewrite of the TypeScript 7 native compiler and language server (the Go module under `tsc/` in microsoft/TypeScript, codename Corsa). Upstream is consumed as a pinned dependency; this repository is the workspace.

The first compiler foundations are implemented: `ts_jsstring` provides the text and position contracts, and `ts_arena` provides storage and ownership primitives. The scanner, parser and semantic checker remain pending. The repository also contains the plan, upstream measurements and a tracking scaffold: a Cargo `xtask`, a file ledger, a function inventory, ADRs and generated status reports. Mapped functions and implementation labels are reported separately from verified parity.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) | The canonical plan. Update the HTML mirror when it changes. |
| [Plan page](docs/corsa-in-rust.html) | The designed HTML mirror. An earlier version was published as a private page at https://claude.ai/code/artifact/6c72abf7-0d30-43fe-a7a8-6457828dcce8; that external copy is not automatically synchronized. |
| [Tracking](docs/TRACKING.md) | Ledger, function-mapping, evidence, experiment and sprint-check contracts. |
| [Current status](STATUS.md), [dashboard](docs/status.html) | Generated reports; evidence validity and parity are separate from implementation and mapping counts. |
| [Unmapped functions](status/unmapped-functions.json) | Complete function worklist linked from the compact JSON status summary. |
| [Architecture decisions](docs/adr/README.md) | Accepted ADRs 0001 to 0018 and the Proposed placeholders 0019 (test-host protocol) and 0020 (Phase 0 gate). |
| `PORTS.toml`, `data/go-functions.tsv` | Upstream file ledger and function inventory used for traceability. |
| `status/runs.toml`, `status/experiments.toml` | Reviewed run specifications and experiment gates. |
| [Phase 0 implementation plan](sprints/README.md), `sprints/` | Sprint files S01 to S12 with machine-checked exit criteria; the README gives the order, producers and conventions. |
| [S04 implementation and measurements](docs/S04.md), `crates/ts_jsstring/`, `crates/ts_arena/` | Implemented text and ownership leaves, differential fixtures, measured scope and reproduction commands. |
| `rust-toolchain.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`, `deny.toml`, `Cargo.toml` lints | Pinned stable toolchain, formatting, dependency policy and the clippy allow-list (ADRs 0016 and 0017); `scripts/checks.py` runs them as producers. |
| `data/divergences.toml` | Owner-approved baseline divergences (ADR 0004); an input of the E2 producer. |
| `.github/workflows/status.yml` | Status workflow: provenance, archived-view check, live producer metrics plus S01/S04 on macOS and Linux, minimum-Rust builds, artifacts including the worklist. |
| `xtask/` | Local commands for evidence capture, status generation and sprint validation. |
| `data/import-graph.txt` | Internal import edges of the Go module (`importer imported`), produced by `go list`. 766 edges. |
| `data/topological-order.txt` | The packages in dependency order, leaves first, produced by `tsort` over the graph. The plan's crate map groups related packages; its dependency slices also use the actual import edges. |
| `data/MEASURED.txt` | Which TypeScript commit and Go version the data was measured with. |
| `scripts/import-graph.sh` | Regenerates `data/` from a TypeScript checkout: `scripts/import-graph.sh ~/git/TypeScript`. |

## Reading order

1. `PLAN.md`, section 1, for the scope and eight-point summary.
2. Section 6 for the architecture decisions, which are where the plan differs from a straight port.
3. Section 9 for prototype dependencies, full parity gates and the spike experiments.
4. Section 5 for the native, WebAssembly and Rust embedding cut-over criteria.
5. Section 13 for remaining implementation choices and settled contracts.
6. [Tracking](docs/TRACKING.md), [status](STATUS.md) and the [ADR index](docs/adr/README.md) for recorded work, current evidence and unresolved decisions.

## Tracking work

`cargo xtask run <run-id>` executes a reviewed specification from `status/runs.toml` and captures typed metrics with evidence bound to the upstream pin, command, that run's selected sources and declared corpus/configuration inputs. `cargo xtask status` validates that evidence and regenerates the reports; `cargo xtask check <sprint>` enforces sprint exit criteria and required item checks. Source globs default to compiler crates, Cargo manifests/lockfile, `.cargo` configuration, Rust toolchain selectors, `xtask` and scripts. Documentation and policy edits do not invalidate measurements unless that producer explicitly consumes those files; declared inputs and case manifests are always hashed.

The ledger's `status`, `rust` and `verify` fields are editable without regenerating upstream provenance. Threshold, sprint-check and ledger-progress changes reevaluate existing metrics; selected source or run-input changes invalidate affected evidence. Metric-producer contracts define the workload and assertions behind each measurement, so neither function markers nor a successful command alone establishes parity. See [Tracking](docs/TRACKING.md) for version-2 provenance, source selection and the run schema.

`cargo xtask check-metrics 'run.fmt.clean == true'` enforces measured results independently of unfinished sprints. `cargo xtask status --check-committed` verifies all four committed views against validated evidence using the recorded context and date, without rewriting files; live gates still require evidence valid for the current host and environment.

## Status

Draft 3.2 measures upstream at microsoft/TypeScript commit `1f70213d49`; implementation progress is updated through 6 September 2026. The canonical `upstream/` submodule is registered at `1f70213d4922b434345f639b441681e470c7cfc1`; the actual Go oracle build and `--version` smoke test have passing execution evidence. ADRs 0006, 0007 and 0013 and the [ownership](docs/design/ownership.md), [symbols](docs/design/symbols.md) and [text](docs/design/text.md) design notes are accepted. The S04 text crate maps 47 upstream functions; its local E4 run matched all 75,997 probes across 400 scenarios. Seven ownership scenarios pass debug, release, Miri and AddressSanitizer checks with captured execution evidence. See [S04](docs/S04.md) for measured scope and commands, and generated status for current evidence and sprint closure. Full E3/E4 acceptance and the remaining experiments stay open in the [Phase 0 plan](sprints/README.md). The installed status workflow requires S01 and S04 on macOS and Linux; no remote workflow run is recorded here.

Native targets are macOS arm64/x64 and Linux x64/arm64 (glibc). The plan specifies file/lazy/bundle ownership, checker-local merges, generation-aware invalidation and raw-byte handling. Repeated identity checks may be elided only within a proven ownership scope, with release-mode rejection required at every unproven boundary. The spike tests bounded memory, WebAssembly and embedding prototypes; full compiler WebAssembly and Rust-consumer acceptance are required before cut-over. The owner approves baseline divergences, and work is sequenced by dependency slices and parity gates rather than a calendar.
